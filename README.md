## Synopsis

Wellbi is a sexual health diagnosis and resource-providing application. Wellbi gives users a simple, stigma-free interface to preliminarily diagnose their sexual health symptoms and also provide appropriate resources, including a sexual health forum on which users can support others and share their symptoms/experiences/resources. In addition, Wellbi provides information about the diagnosed condition and about nearby medical clinics. Wellbi is the first step in receiving physical and emotional support when experiencing sexual-health-related symptoms.
